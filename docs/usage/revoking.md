This will allow you to revoke a specific token so that it can no longer access your endpoints.you will have to choose what token you want to check against the denylist. Denylist works by providing a callback function to this extension, using the <b>token_in_denylist_loader()</b>. This method will be called whenever the specified token <i>(access and/or refresh)</i> is used to access a protected endpoint. If the callback function says that the token is revoked, we will not allow the requester to continue, otherwise we will allow the requester to access the endpoint as normal.

Here is a basic example use token revoking:

```python
{!../examples/denylist.py!}
```

In production, you will likely want to use either a database or in-memory store (such as Redis) to store your tokens. memory stores are great if you are wanting to revoke a token when the users log out and you can define timeout to your token in Redis, after the timeout has expired, the token will automatically be deleted.

Here example use Redis for revoking a token:

```python
```
